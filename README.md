Modified agents introduction: In this project, we basically implement an A* search algorithm to a path finding agent. The agent can help a footman find a path to the enemy townhall in the maze. If an enemy footman blocked his moving path, the agent will also help him recalculate his way to the townhall and avoid the enemy footman.

We have a good exprience with the documentation. It's easily readble and understandable at most of places. One improvement can take is to delare more clearly about how to set up the class file.

We had a trouble with running our agent on the dynamic configuration. It will print codes in terminate step block over and over. We checked through the codes but cannot find any solutions, because it seemed something wrong with the codes provided and the logic behind the Sepia.It cannot terminate the game process like other graphs do.
